Routepedia
=====================

*Problem*
An organization has cab pick-up or drop-off facilities for employees to commute between office/home. 
A solution is needed that will minimize waiting time, traveltime for employees using office trasnport facility. 

*Solution*
The reason for employees spending more time in cab apart from traffic and other factors is the way pickup or drops are calculated based on some random assumptions about which route is shortest. 

**Shortest path algorithm based on distance and time**
We need to channelize this process in better way by implementing an application based on “shortest path algorithm”. Consider the employee and their pick up/drop off locations are permanent mostly we can feed up system with employee and location. A online form over will allow employee to register for cab facility which will in turn add up to route. This forum will also serve as official request for obtaining cab facility to admin division. Once everything is finalized admin team can hand over shortest path calculation to driver in order to get started with minimalistic delay.

**Features**
1. Routes per trasport will be calculated as shortest path (distance and time)
2. Notification just before pick-up is scheduled (email/SMS)
3. Recommended time slot (allowing more flexibility)
4. Travel itinerary included ETA for drop-off, routes details, etc
