shortestpathalgorithm
=====================

Problem Description: An organization has cab pick-up or drop-off facilities for employees to commute between office/home. Solution to provide less time possible during transport. Solution: The reason for employees spending more time in cab apart from traffic and other factors is the way pickup or drops are calculated based on some random assumptions about which route is shortest. We need to channelize this process in better way by implementing an application based on “shortest path algorithm”. Consider the employee and their pick up/drop off locations are permanent mostly we can feed up system with employee and location. A online form over will allow employee to register for cab facility which will in turn add up to route. This forum will also serve as official request for obtaining cab facility to admin division. Once everything is finalized admin team can hand over shortest path calculation to driver in order to get started with minimalistic delay.
